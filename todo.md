On this page will live a list of things to do on the site: ideas, suggestions, thoughts, speculation 


- twitter or similar in the right-column 
- consider the differences between github user and project pages - and how jekyll could be used in the context of a project page, e.g. for the python belts or the L8 C# course 
- automate the tags pages 
- put the dates in the main list 
- playing with the [theming](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
- have a place for known useful links
  - [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet]
- limit the front page to *some time limit* or *most recent x posts*

  

And, then there are some posts with [questions](/tags/question), almost certainly content, not structural to this site!
