## Git SSH Keys

Fundamentally, follow [the instructions] (https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)


1. Check for existing keys: 

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist
```

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.


Start the ssh-agent in the background.

```bash
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566
```

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

```
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Then add the key to the GitHub account. 

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard.

Past into the setting > new key box 

```bash
$ ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to GitHub
```

Finally, git clone with the required repo.
