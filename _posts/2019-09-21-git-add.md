To add all the files in the current directiory: 

`git add .`

Then to commit, use the `-m` flag to add a message with a quoted string. 

`git commit -m "msg"`

Of course, this presupposes that you've configured the environment first: 

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"


Then push to the server: 

`git push`

This is fine if you've not locked the repo.
