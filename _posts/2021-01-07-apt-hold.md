As mentioned [yesterday]({% link _posts/2021-01-06-obs-lower-third.md %}) I needed to hold back a package from update. 

Ordinarily you can run `apt update` and then `apt upgrade` - but what you if you don't want to upgrade, but want apt to manage it? 

So first install [the target version](https://askubuntu.com/questions/428772/how-to-install-specific-version-of-some-package) (you might need to uninstall the package first), then [use the `hold` keyword](https://askubuntu.com/questions/18654/how-to-prevent-updating-of-a-specific-package) to have `apt` manage the process of ignoring that package when updating.
