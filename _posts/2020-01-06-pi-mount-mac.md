[Brew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager (think apt) but for Mac (and apparently for WSL too).

Then there's [this website]
(https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/mount-raspberry-pi-sd-card-on-mac-read-only-osxfuse-and-ext4fuse) that discusses mounting on the Mac. 

But it seems that [Linux can mount directly (and perhaps unsurprisingly)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=45638).
