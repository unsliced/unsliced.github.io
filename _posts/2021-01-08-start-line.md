There are many reasons to run a race, for many it might just be a way to checkpoint that their training is working, but it could just as easily be the endpoint for that training; I know that I train better if I've a goal and a race, with a goal is a great focus. 

Most training plans that you can find on the web (whether it's couch to 5k, half, full marathon or longer) are based on weeks and probably cycles of weeks, i.e. weeks with particular focus, with light weeks and heavier ones mixed up. 

Many plans have target times baked in, your race distance and target time combine to give you suggested paces for the various settings, equally, once you've started training, your sessions will start to focus you towards your times. 

So when I did last year's [TP100](https://www.centurionrunning.com/reports/2020/tp100-2020-race-report) I started with 3 goals: 

1. my gold standard was 22 hours, that was the target I had plugged in to my watch (Garmin have this very whizzy [PacePro](https://www.fitness-tracker-test.info/en/garmin-pacepro/) functionality with allows you to twiddle the target time for every kilometre along a course based on incline and negative split) - early on, despite thinking I was holding back, I was nearly 2 hours ahead of time and points ... despite eventually missing by an hour!
1. silver was 24 hours, this is the industry standard 24 hour time (I think based on the [Western States](https://www.wser.org/awards/) event); while every course is different, 24 hours is typically rewarded with a buckle. While anyone who finishes is heroic, 24 hours is definitely not just turning up. 
1. and, of course, just finishing. 

But one of the conversations I had on the race gave me a fourth: just getting to the start line. 

Especially for the longer distances, but for some 5k counts for that, just getting to the start having accumulated enough training to make getting to the finish a realistic goal, well, that's a lofty aim. 

Train to be able to start so as to be able to finish; have a target for sure, but don't forget to give yourself credit for work already done. As an old coach of mine used to say of **every** training session: "that's one in the bank", race day is when you spend it.
