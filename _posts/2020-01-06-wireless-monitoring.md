## WPA cracking
[Cracking WPA passwords](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2018/06/crack-wireless-passwords-raspberry-pi-aircrack/) certainly gave some ideas (in particular using the [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=Main#documentation) suite, include [airmon](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng)). 

## Pi and Linux projects
Interesting projects include: 
	- a [go based pi solution](https://github.com/meyersj/wifi). 
	- a [pi network scanner](https://makezine.com/projects/build-raspberry-pi-network-scanner/)
	- [Kismet](https://kismetwireless.net/) looks to be very useful. 

## Python solutions
