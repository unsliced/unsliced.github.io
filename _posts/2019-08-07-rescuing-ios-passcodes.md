## iPhoneBackupExtractor

In particular with reference to a screentime (a.k.a. the restrictions) passcode the [iPhone Backup Extractor](https://www.iphonebackupextractor.com/guides/recover-screen-time-parental-restrictions-passcode/) is a useful tool. 

It does need an encrypted backup (without that the passwords are not backed up) and, of course, do remember to write down somewhere, e.g. LastPass, that password.
