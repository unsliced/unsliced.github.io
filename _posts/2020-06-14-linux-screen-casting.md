According to [this post](https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-screen-recorders/) if you want screen casting in Linux then [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is the way to go. If the only Con is that *You’ll need a while to figure out its terminology* which itself is then tempered with *but it’s worth it*, it's probably worth considering. Loom on Windows is fine, but it is limited.
