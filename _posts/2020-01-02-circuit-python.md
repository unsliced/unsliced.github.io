The latest UF2 for CircuitPython from [here](https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/). (Hit the Reset button twice and drop the UF2 on to the CPLAYBOOT drive, as [described here](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython)). Make sure the [library bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) is up to date too (into /lib).

You can [listen in to the serial point with PuTTY](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-windows).
