There are only [two hard things in computer science](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) and Garmin (amongst others) just got bit by one of them. It turns out that 2020 had 53 weeks (week 1 has the first Thursday of January in it, so it means that if that's the first (or, in a leap year the second) then the 53rd Thursday is also officially in that year), a fact that apparently spooked the Sony chipset, as outlined by [DC Rainmaker](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/01/gps-accuracy-impacting-devices.html).

There really isn't much excuse and while this was a self-solving problem, it's not what we expect from expensive watches and global companies.
