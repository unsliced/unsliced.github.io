According to [the RPi docs](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) (using `snap` not `apt` [mind](https://snapcraft.io/rpi-imager)), we should be able to use the `rpi-imager` app - but I'm on Ubuntu 20.04 and I think that might be too new. 

Fortunately, there are [other ways to install using Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md). 

Then the [latest version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/), Buster, is on. Well, it looks like it.
