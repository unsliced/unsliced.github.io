## Ring doorbell - WiFi 

While it should, in principle, be as simple as finding your 2.4 GHz signal, apparently [channel 13 is not allowed](https://support.ring.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115004734423-My-Ring-Device-is-Having-Trouble-With-My-Wi-Fi-Signal-EU-UK-or-AUS-NZ). 

Question: can we restrict the NetGear router to only broadcast from 1 to 11?
