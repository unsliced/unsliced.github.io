## Level 2 

The blog will be here to keep notes and instructions. 

Need to look into the [front matter variables issue](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/), especially to get tags working. 

There is some sort of [semi-manual solution here](https://www.assertnotmagic.com/2017/04/25/jekyll-tags-the-easy-way/) - worth investigating.
